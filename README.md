# LuaBox

A Lua VM inside an UWP app, plus some basic UI. If you ever wanted to, you can now run Lua 5.3 on your Xbox Series X/S.

This was a just-for-fun weekend project; I've never written any code for Microsoft platforms nor much C++ before, so the code is basically a mess. However it hacking around in Lua's source code to make it work inside UWP was a decent bit of fun.
